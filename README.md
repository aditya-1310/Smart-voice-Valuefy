## Project Description
### **Smart Voice Assistant for Professionals**  

This project is an **AI-powered voice assistant** designed to help professionals **automatically capture, process, and organize** key insights from meetings. It allows users to **record conversations, transcribe speech into text, extract important action items, and send structured summaries via email**.  

### **How It Works**  
1. **Voice Transcription** â€“ Users record conversations, which are transcribed into text in real-time.  
2. **Summarization with Gemini AI** â€“ The transcribed text is processed using **Google Gemini AI**, which intelligently extracts key points, tasks, and meeting details.  
3. **Email Integration** â€“ The generated summary is automatically formatted and sent via email for easy reference and follow-ups.  

### **Tech Stack**  
ðŸ”¹ **Frontend:** React.js â€“ A dynamic and responsive UI for seamless user interaction.  
ðŸ”¹ **Backend:** Node.js & Express â€“ Handles API requests, processes transcriptions, and integrates with Gemini AI.  
ðŸ”¹ **AI Processing:** Google Gemini AI â€“ Summarizes key meeting insights and extracts action points.  
ðŸ”¹ **Email Service:** Nodemailer â€“ Sends the summarized meeting notes via email.  

By combining **AI-driven summarization** with **automated email sharing**, this project streamlines meeting workflows, ensuring professionals can stay engaged in discussions without losing critical information. ðŸš€
